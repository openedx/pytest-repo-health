~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removed
_______

* Removed support for Python 3.5.  Versions 3.5.3 and above will likely still work for now, but they are no longer being tested; this lets us upgrade some dependencies and avoid confusion when aiohttp fails to install under 3.5.2 and below.  Python 3.5 reaches EOL in 1 month anyway.

Fixed
_____

* Recent versions of github.py installed from source control are now supported (and recommended if you want to inspect a repository's code of conduct, as 0.5.0 has a bug that throws an exception when attempting this).
* Checks can now be run on a ``.github`` repository (the regular expression used to parse out the organization and repository names didn't work with this before)
